🦺 3. PPE Compliance Rules Engine

Instead of “just detection”:

Define rules per ROI:

Helmet required ❌

Vest required ❌

Gloves optional

Rule examples:

Zone A → Helmet + Vest mandatory

Zone B → Helmet only

This makes your product configurable, not hardcoded.

🚨 4. Real-Time Alerts (VERY IMPORTANT)

In-app alerts

Email alerts

Crowd threshold:

If people > 5 → stricter PPE rules

AI confidence threshold per ROI
